    <h3>How good is this one, my personal favourite for quick lunchtime snag</h3>
    <p>These super easy pizza bagels make for an ultimate student snack and can be rustled up in just 3 minutes with a grand total of 3 steps.
        As well as the standard tomato and cheese, you can also chuck on your own toppings, although things like meats should be already cooked.
