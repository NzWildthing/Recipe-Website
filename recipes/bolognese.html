        <li>500g minced beef</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a little oil in a frying pan and cook the mince, seasoned with a little salt and pepper, for around 3-5 minutes until browned. You may have to do this in batches as you don’t want to crowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Set the meat aside and return the pan to the heat.</li>
        <li>Fry the garlic, onions, mushrooms and carrots in a little oil for a 5-10 minutes until the veggies begin to soften.</li>
        <li>Add in the chopped tomatoes and stock.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with salt, pepper, dried herbs (around a teaspoon will do) and a splash of Worcestershire sauce – or more if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Stir everything together and reduce the heat. Cover and leave to simmer for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Check every 5-10 minutes and give it a stir.</li>
        <li>Serve with spaghetti or other pasta!</li>
