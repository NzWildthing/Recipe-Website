    <h3>A classic staple in british meals</h3>
    <p>An easy to follow and cheap recipe to make for students on that glorious student loan. Just like mum
        used to make it, in a little as 20 minutes.

        <il>In a baking dish, drizzle around the oil inside.</il>
        <il>Add the sausages and cook in the oven at 200 degrees for 10 minutes.</il>
        <il>While the sausages cook, add the flour to a big bowl and whisk in the milk and eggs until you’ve got a runny batter.</il>
